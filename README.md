# Amazon Braket Algorithm Library
The Braket Algorithm Library provides Amazon Braket customers with 20 pre-built implementations of prominent quantum algorithms and experimental workloads as ready-to-run example notebooks.

---
Currently, braket algorithms are tested on Linux and Max. We recommend using Linux or Max because the certain electronic structure packages are only compatible on these platforms.

  * [**Grover's search algorithm**]

    Grover's algorithm is arguably one of the canonical quantum algorithms that kick-started the field of quantum computing. In the future, it could possibly serve as a hallmark application of quantum computing. Grover's algorithm allows us to find a particular register in an unordered database with $N$ entries with computational complexity $O(\\sqrt{N})$.

  * [**Violation of Bell's Inequality**]

    Bell’s Inequality shows that certain predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be explained by local interactions and inherent physical properties. Instead, we must give up the assumption of either (1) some pre-existing physical property that the measurement “uncovers” or (2) that the measurements are not causally related.

  * [**Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm**]

    The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm finds the hidden string in an oracle with just a single application
    of the oracle. The algorithm was one of the first examples to demonstrate quasi-polynomial speed-up over a probabilistic classical computer.

## <a name="conda">Creating a conda environment</a>
To install the dependencies required for running the notebook examples in this repository you can create a conda environment with below commands.

```bash
conda env create -n <your_env_name> -f environment.yml
```

Activate the conda environment using:
```bash
conda activate <your_env_name>
```

To remove the conda environment use:
```bash
conda deactivate
```

For more information, please see [conda usage](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

To run the notebook examples locally on your IDE, first, configure a profile to use your account to interact with AWS. To learn more, see [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

After you create a profile, use the following command to set the `AWS_PROFILE` so that all future commands can access your AWS account and resources.

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_PROFILE_NAME
```

The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is an important subroutine to many quantum algorithms, most famously Shor's algorithm for factoring and the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. The QFT can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, using only single-qubit Hadamard gates and two-qubit controlled phase shift gates, where is the number of qubits. We first review the basics of the quantum Fourier transform, and its relation to the discrete (classical) Fourier transform.

The QFT is an important subroutine to many quantum algorithms, most famously Shor's algorithm for factoring and the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. The QFT can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, using only single-qubit Hadamard gates and two-qubit controlled phase shift gates, where is the number of qubits. We first review the basics of the quantum Fourier transform, and its relation to the discrete (classical) Fourier transform.

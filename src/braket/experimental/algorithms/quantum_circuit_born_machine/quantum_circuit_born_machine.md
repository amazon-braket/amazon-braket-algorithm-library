Quantum circuits are a natural fit for generative modeling because they are inherently probabilistic; the wavefunction encodes a probability according to the Born rule. In quantum mechanics, we do not have access to directly, but we can efficiently sample using projective measurements. This is an implicit generative model similar to generative adversarial networks (GANs). Quantum circuits allow fast sampling from a high-dimension distribution, and have large expressive power.

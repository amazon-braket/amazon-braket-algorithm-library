The quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM) is a variational quantum algorithm used for generative modeling. The QCBM encodes a target probability distribution into the parameters of rotation gates and entangling operations in a quantum circuit. The QCBM allows sampling from a high-dimension distribution according to the Born rule.

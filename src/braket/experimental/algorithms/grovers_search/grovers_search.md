Grover's algorithm is arguably one of the canonical quantum algorithms that kick-started the field of quantum computing. In the future, it could possibly serve as a hallmark application of quantum computing. Grover's algorithm allows us to find a particular register in an unordered database with N entries in just O(sqrt(N)) steps, compared to the best classical algorithm taking on average N/2 steps, thereby providing a quadratic speedup. For large databases (with a large number of entries, N), a quadratic speedup can provide a significant advantage. For a database with one million entries, a quantum computer running Grover's algorithm would need about 1000 runs, while a classical computer would need, on average, 500,000 runs.

The Hadamard test is a quantum circuit that allows estimation of the real and imaginary parts of the expected value of a unitary operator. It is a fundamental subroutine used in many quantum algorithms, including quantum phase estimation and amplitude estimation. The test works by applying a controlled-unitary operation between an auxiliary qubit and the system of interest, with the measurement statistics of the auxiliary qubit encoding information about the unitary's expectation value.

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) belongs to the class of hybrid quantum algorithms (leveraging both classical as well as quantum compute), that are widely believed to be the working horse for the current NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era. In this NISQ era QAOA is also an emerging approach for benchmarking quantum devices and is a prime candidate for demonstrating a practical quantum speed-up on near-term NISQ device.

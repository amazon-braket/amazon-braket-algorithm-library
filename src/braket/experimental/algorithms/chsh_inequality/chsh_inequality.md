CHSH (Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt) inequality is one of the Bell's inequalities which shows that certain predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be explained by local interactions and inherent physical properties. Instead, we must give up the assumption of either (1) some pre-existing physical property that the measurement "uncovers" or (2) that the measurements are not causally related.

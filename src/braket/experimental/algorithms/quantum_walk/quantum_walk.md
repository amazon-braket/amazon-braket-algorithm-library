The quantum walk is very similar to the classical walk, where a walker observes a random process, such as flipping a coin, followed by deciding its next step conditioned on the outcome of the random process. For quantum walker, it observes a quantum process instead, and the subsequent steps are superpositions of the possible steps that a classical walker would take.

###############################

The Braket Algorithm Library provides Amazon Braket customers with pre-built implementations of prominent quantum algorithms and experimental workloads as ready-to-run example notebooks.

Currently, Braket algorithms are tested on Linux, Windows, and Mac.

Running notebooks locally requires additional dependencies located in notebooks/textbook/requirements.txt https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-braket-algorithm-library/blob/main/notebooks/textbook/requirements.txt. See notebooks/textbook/README.md for more information.
